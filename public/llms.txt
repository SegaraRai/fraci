# Fraci - Fractional Indexing

> Fraci is a TypeScript library that provides robust, performant, and secure fractional indexing with first-class support for Drizzle ORM and Prisma ORM. Fractional indexing allows maintaining ordered lists without requiring reindexing when items are inserted or moved.

Fraci offers both string-based and binary-based fractional indexing implementations, with the binary version providing better performance and smaller storage requirements. The library includes first-class integrations for Drizzle ORM and Prisma ORM with strongly typed APIs.

## Features

- String-based and binary-based fractional indexing
- ORM integrations for Drizzle and Prisma
- Automatic conflict resolution
- TypeScript support with branded types
- Zero dependencies
